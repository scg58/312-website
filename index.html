One of his idols was the folk singer Woody Guthrie. He was also influenced by the early authors of the Beat Generation, as well as by modernist poets.

           <p>Bob Dylan is considered to be the greatest influence on popular culture of all time. Bob Dylan was not born an idol—his legacy as a result of his surroundings. Throughout Bob Dylan’s life, he has been somehow affected by various historical events, such as the after-shocks of the world wars, improvement of TV in society, Kennedy’s assassination, and the civil rights movement; it was these changes in society that influenced Dylan to write music that would in turn evoke changes within society itself

                 <h3>Today</h3>
                 <p>In 2018, Dylan was one of the artists featured on the six-track EP Universal Love: Wedding Songs Reimagined, a collection of classics from various eras revised with same-sex pronouns. Dylan recorded the 1929 standard "She's Funny That Way" as "He's Funny That Way," while later hits like "My Girl" and "And Then He Kissed Me" also received fresh takes with a pronoun twist.That year the iconic songwriter also launched a whiskey brand called Heaven’s Door Spirits. He is still producing music, touring, and continuing his legacy today.
